    <h1>Introduction to Zero-Days and the Zero-Day Marketplace</h1>
     <p>Warfare has transformed with technology, but the principles have always been the same. The invention of the Internet brought us into the age of digital warfare, and missiles were replaced with computer exploits. Nations gather these exploits like an arms race to stay ahead of their rivals, and government agencies around the world pay top dollar for zero-day exploits that give them that edge in the cyber arms race.</p>

    <h2>Zero-Day</h2>
    <p>A <em>zero-day</em> exploit is a vulnerability that can be used to gain access to target hosts and is unknown to the manufacturer of the software or device. The name specifically references that the vendor has had zero days to address the exploit. According to Perlroth, “At the most basic level a zero-day is a software or hardware flaw for which there is no existing patch.” Exploits are rated in terms of the severity of the vulnerability, the lowest might only offer small information about the host and the highest severity is remote code execution with system or root access. These zero-days are extremely valuable, but they are also extremely fragile as vendors are quick to address critical vulnerabilities when they become aware of them. For this reason, a zero-day is typically used as a last resort when no other strategies prove successful. </p>
    <p>The most valuable zero-days are like having a secret, devastating weapon in your arsenal. With it, an attacker can gain access to critical systems that can completely compromise networks such as critical domain controllers in active directory environments. When properly weaponized, they can be used by pointing them at a target and clicking, enabling any agent of the owner to get access to that system. The most notorious weaponized zero-day exploits came from the US Government, specifically the National Security Agency. In 2017, a group calling themselves the Shadow Brokers released NSA tools to the public. These tools included weaponized zero-day exploits such as Eternal Blue which takes advantage of the critical MS17-010 vulnerability, a devastating Server Message Block (SMB) attack that grants remote system access. This weaponized exploit was used in malware to spread across networks around the world, the most notorious being the WannaCry worm. This malware utilized various tools including leaked NSA exploits and mimikatz to compromise entire networks around the world and encrypt the data so that it could never be recovered. </p>


    <h2>Zero-Day Brokers</h2>
    <p>How <strong>much</strong> will organizations pay for these secret weapons, either to use them for their own purposes or to prevent them from being used against their customers? Today, many vendors will publicly implement bug bounty programs where they ask hackers to find and report vulnerabilities in their products and applications. In 2020, Apple paid $100,000 for a critical bug which does incentivize hackers to come forth with their findings, but this is a relatively new relationship between hackers and vendors. Throughout the years, most hackers who disclosed vulnerabilities and exploits to vendors were threatened by them with legal action to prevent the public from knowing about the problem with their products (Perlroth, 2021).</p>
    <p>Information Security companies in the dot-com era would often search for vulnerabilities and offer them to vendors to help protect their clients, but this was a slow and inefficient process that did not generate a lot of revenue (Perlroth, 2021). Ex-employees of various government agencies had other ideas, and contractors started approaching those same government agencies with their own exploits. In the early days, the NSA held all the best and brightest talents, but they were not the only ones interested in the intelligence someone could gather through cyberespionage. Other agencies began to outsource zero-days to these contractors, but the demand became overwhelming for a small team (Perlroth, 2021). The contractors began to buy exploits from hackers around the world, but this required an immense amount of trust and secrecy. If an exploit was leaked to the vendor, the buyer and seller no longer had anything of value.</p>
    <p>The most efficient markets require transparency and honesty, two traits that the zero-day market actively fought against. This led to shady middlemen, slow transactions, long vetting processes, and duplication of government spending as multiple agencies purchased the same zero-days at full price (Perlroth, 2021). The market required so much cloak-and-dagger that it was only a matter of time before it was brought into the light. In 2007, Charlie Miller released a whitepaper about the underground marketplace for exploits (Perlroth, 2021). Charlie, or Zero-Day Charlie as he was known for his exploits against the “secure” Apple devices of the time, worked at the NSA for a short time. He was more interested in the academics of hacking, but he was aware of a glaring issue between the way the vendors treated hackers and how government organizations required their skills. He released a whitepaper detailing his experience as he sold an exploit to the government, but he also released his findings about the inconsistent payments governments made. He knew hackers that were paid $10,000 for their findings, and others who made over $250,000 for similar exploits. He eventually began advocating against giving vendors bugs for free based on the way the vendors still treated hackers, propelling both the underground exploit marketplace to wider reaches and also setting the stage for the bug bounty programs many vendors have adopted.</p>
    <p>Government organizations will still go to extreme lengths to keep these zero-days a secret, leading to ethical questions about controlling vulnerabilities that expose the government’s citizens to cyberattacks. Many companies around the world have gotten into the business of cyberwarfare by selling exploits and infrastructure to governments, but they are not typically privy to how their tools are used. Many hackers involved in the market are unwilling to discuss their business, but it seems clear that for many they choose to stick their heads in the sand so they can make good money. When the market was brought into the light, vendors were outraged that their own government was partaking in it and hoarding these zero-days that put their customers at risk. While the market is still shrouded in secrecy and darkness, it is clear that many nations around the world are hoarding cyber weapons reminiscent of the Cold War nuclear arms race.</p>
